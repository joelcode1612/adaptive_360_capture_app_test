/// The one Flutter-aware piece of the Section 1 capture module.
///
/// Everything below it — the 26 directions, the station frame, the alignment
/// maths, the stability gate — is pure Dart and tested without a binding. This
/// class does the four things that genuinely need the platform:
///
/// * it probes ARCore, starts the session and subscribes to the pose stream;
/// * it turns a pose into a station, a target into an anchor, and an anchor into
///   a scene the native renderer draws;
/// * it decides when the shutter may fire, from tracking, anchoring, alignment
///   **and** steadiness together;
/// * it owns the photograph's save → verify → record ordering.
///
/// A [ChangeNotifier] rather than a state-management package, for the same
/// reason the existing capture flow uses one: the screen is the only consumer
/// and a second copy of the state is how the two drift apart.
///
/// ## Anchor refresh
///
/// `_refreshAnchorIfDue` runs twice a second. A **paused** anchor is not
/// recovered by re-placing it at all: ARCore pauses a world anchor whenever
/// its own tracking degrades and resumes it by itself, and the marker keeps
/// its world position and stays in the scene throughout. If the shared station
/// anchor is gone, the frozen geometry is invalidated and the user must
/// recalibrate; recreating one target under a different anchor would break the
/// coherent 26-target arrangement.

/// A displayed station-drift warning enters at the unchanged 0.20 m safety
/// limit. It can clear only after a raw measurement is at or below 0.18 m for
/// this long. At the native 20 Hz pose delivery rate that is about ten samples:
